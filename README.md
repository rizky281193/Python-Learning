## Getting Started

To start this training, of course you need the ability to understand the python programming language, starting from creating functions, variable declarations, selecting in python and loops, and understanding a few functions in the openCV package. If you don't understand, you can read about *Python* [here](https://docs.python.org/3/) and *OpenCV* [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)

### Prerequisites

  - *Python Version > 3*
  - *IDE Tools (Here I am using pyCharm CE)*
